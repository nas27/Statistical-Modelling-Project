# Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
This project seeks to explore Python for data analytics, utilize APIs effectively, employ data wrangling tactics, exploratory data analysis, visualizations, a regression modelling. I will be further using statistical techniques to interpret and practice using Pandas and Numpy.

### Structure:

- ./data folder: csv files of dataframes
- ./images: png files of data visualizations
- ./notebooks: analysis and coding work

## Process
#### Step 1
Started by checking out the API documentation and tested out a Yelp/Foursquare endpoints.

Ran the below GET req via Postman to confirm working data.

(http://api.citybik.es/v2/networks?fields=EcoBici,name,company)

### Step 2
Request data from Foursquare and Yelp and start exploring and cleaning the data.

### Step 3
Combine the data if necessary. Future goal: create an index in my loop when requesting data for later joins.

### Step 4
Review statistically modelling techniques.
Interpret the model programmatically generated for me.


## Results
I found that Yelp and Foursquare provide different data as such serve two different purposes. Yelp is all about rating and tracking the restaurant/bar/establishment reviews.
Foursquare seems to focus on location data has additional feature such as sorting by distance, because proximity is relevant to their use case.

## Challenges 

Limitations of free API usage - had to wait min 24 hours for request limit to reset.


## Future Goals
Add more data audit/cleansing
Create more data visualizations in EDA phase.
I would explore other APIS i.e. weather APIs and try to further derive insights.
